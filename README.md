File test.js has solutions to some Hackerrank tasks from the job interview preparation kit.

Respective functions with solutions are added individually and previous ones are commented.

To run and test the required approach:

1. Comment on all other functions
2. Open index.html in a browser
3. See the result in the console log (Dev tools)

New solutions are added from time to time.
